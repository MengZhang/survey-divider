Steps to making this work:

1. Translate the inputs to JSON
2. Figure out the weather stations
3. Split data by weather stations -or- by # of simulations

After this, each of these steps is run by every seperated group
4. Translate to the model
5. Run the model
6. Translate the outputs to ACMO

After all of these processes are run, merge the groups
7. Merge ACMOs and keep in order
